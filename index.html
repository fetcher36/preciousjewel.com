		<h1>PRECIOUS JEWEL'S MARRIAGE JOURNEY</h1>
		<h2>My Marriage Journey At A Glance</h2> 
	
	
	Hi there, if you are reading this, you are just in time at the right place! I'm going to take you on a little and interesting journey into how my marriage journey actually began, and I believe you can learn a thing or two as you read on.
	Going through the web, you would find loads of write-ups, both interesting and uninteresting regarding marriage. And, hey, I'm not saying I'm an expert in the field of marriage, because even experts do have divorce.
	Hence, the only Expert and Authority in marriage is God Almighty because He created it. 
	<p>However, all I can say for now is that, to have a great and successful marriage, you (the couple) must both <i>love</i> and <i>understanding</i> one another. These are the keys, and they must be put into action concurrently. Yes, that's that. Hack! before I deviate into giving marriage advice, which this article is not about, let me remind you that today's write-up is for 
	<b>Precious Jewel's Marriage Journey</b>
	<p>
	Yes! So, it all started in April of 2021 when I got that strange phone call. I call it <i>strange</i> because it was never expected. As a matter of fact, I was just on my own when my phone rang.
